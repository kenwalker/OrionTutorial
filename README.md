OrionTutorial
=============

This project contains an Orion tutorial that will grow in exercises and documentation over time.

To use this Tutorial, you should [download Orion 2.0](http://download.eclipse.org/orion/drops/R-2.0-201302221257/index.html "Download Orion 2.0").

Once you've downloaded, you can run the Orion executable and then navigate to the [Localhost Orion landing page](http://localhost:8080 "Orion Localhost").

Create a user with the name __tutorial__ (with whatever password, email not required). Knowing your username, the tutorial can use links that will open up properly.

__It is important__ that you create the user __tutorial__ and log in with it.  There are embedded links throughout this presentation that will only currently work with a localhost orion on 8080 and with the tutorial user.

For example, once you're logged in you can [Clone the Orion Tutorial](http://localhost:8080/git/git-repository.html#,cloneGitRepository=git://github.com/kenwalker/OrionTutorial.git "Clone the Orion Tutorial") into your localhost Orion. And then [Navigate into the Tutorial](http://localhost:8080/navigate/table.html#/file/tutorial/OrionTutorial/?depth=1 "Navigate into the Orion Tutorial on Localhost")
